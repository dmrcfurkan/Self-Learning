1. `<html>`
1. `<head>`
1. `<title>`
1. `<meta>`
1. `<body>`

## 1.HTML 
The `<html>` tag encompasses all other tags. Without using the HTML tag, other tags would be meaningless

## 2.Head
This tag represents the area where the page is introduced to the browser and search engines (with Meta tags) and where CSS and JavaScript files are included. The content we add inside the `<head>` area will not be visible on the web page.

## 3.Title
The `<title>` tag, also known as the headline tag, can be defined as the HTML element that specifies the title of the page on the website. When a term is searched, these titles are the first to appear on the search engine results page. When users click on the attention-grabbing, blue-colored title tags, they enter the page.

## 4. Meta
`<Meta>` tags convey basic information about the page to browsers and search engines. In this way, search engines learn what the page is about and list the results according to that information. They also provide valuable information about the page content.

## 5.Body
The `<body>` is the area and HTML tag in which all the content, tables, headlines, and all other elements you can think of are displayed in an HTML page. All the elements you see on this page are located within the body. When creating an HTML page, there are two important tags. Generally, when designing, work is done between the `<body>` tags
